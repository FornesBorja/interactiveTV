## Features
- **Volume buttons:** You can turn up and down the volume (and it really does!).

- **Last channel memory:** Remembers the last channel viewed when the TV is turned on again.

- **Buttons are disable if TV is off** 

- **Responsive Design:** The website adjusts to different screen sizes.

- **Parental block** Ability to block a channel.

## How to use
The **"OK"** button is used both to confirm and to open the menu. With the buttons surrounding it, you can navigate through this menu. The **number buttons** allow you to directly switch to the desired channel or enter the parental lock password. <br/>

To use parental control, you must first go to the channel you want to censor. Then, open the menu by pressing the **"OK"** button and choose the **"block channel"** option. This way, the channel will be blocked. If you want to unblock it, simply go to the channel and, using the remote control buttons, enter the parental password, which is **"222"**. Once the password is entered, the channel will be unblocked.

## Installation
You can clone the repository at:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FornesBorja/interactiveTV.git
```

## Future functionalities
- **Persistent Channel Memory:** Save the last channel even after refreshing the page.
- **More menu options** Enable functionality for the menu options that are currently not working like channel blocking. This feature will allow users to block the channel of their choice, the settings and Other.

## To improve and bugs
🔲 Info shows channel -1 when there's no channel. <br/>
🔲 When a channel is block it doesn't show the right channel number in info <br/>
🔲 When a channel is block you can't navigate through CH+ and CH- buttons <br/>
🔲 Better controller layout. <br/>
🔲 Easier and more intuitive menu. Currently, you have only 2 options if you want to exit the menu: turn off the TV or press exit.
